Unique identifier generation package.
2 types of generators.
Simple generators return long identifiers.
Complex generators return Object identifiers.
Many instances could be used at the same time in an application
but usually only one instance is used through out the entire system.
This unique generator must be initialized at startup and set as default
with the package home class (IdgenHome).
An identifier must be unique in the scope of its generator implementation.
2 instances of the same generator implementation in the same or in different
processes can not return the same identifiers.
This means the implementation must be chosen for good.
